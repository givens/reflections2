Udacity Lesson 3
================

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories seem useful for working together and keeping back ups.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

An automatic pull may break your local repository by introducing changes which don't work with your changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is on github.  A clone starts with github.  A branch occurs in a local repository.  I have some sense of when I should use each one.


Commands:
---------

git remote  |    Show all remote locations for the repository
git remote add origin url |     Add a new remote location for the repository. Origin is the default name to use when you create only one remote location. Url should be the https url to the github repository.
git remote -v  |    Outputs the remote locations with verbose information (fetch and push urls)
git push origin master  |    Push the master branch to the remote location origin.
git pull origin master  |    Get the master branch from the remote location origin.
git pull origin master  |    = Git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master
git fetch origin  |    Get the changes from the remote location into the (hidden?) origin/master branch
