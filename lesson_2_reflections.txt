What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git directory is added and changes start being tracked.  We do it to let git know which directory trees we want tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is necessary to commit some but not all of the changed files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can add files to the staging area that make logical sense.  Then commit them together.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches separate code development paths or doing something different.  I can develop the main asteroids game and an easy-mode rather than toggling back and forth or keeping them in distinct directories.
