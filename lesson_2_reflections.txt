What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git directory is added and changes start being tracked.  We do it to let git know which directory trees we want tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is necessary to commit some but not all of the changed files.
